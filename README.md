# HardcodedInterpretor

 model-view-controller architectural pattern & the object-oriented concepts
 
 * Model: Design and Implementation of the classes for the toy language statements. 
 * Repository: The repository must contain the state of a program. 
 * Controller: The controller maintains a reference to the respository. The reference type is an interface such that we can easily modify the repository implementation.
 * View: For the menu option "input a program" the users can select a program from the programs already hardcoded in the main method.

 In this project there are 4 child apps from ToyGui_statemets parent. Here are implemented, one by one, some synchronization mechanisms: CyclicBarrier, CountDownLatch, Lock, Semaphore.
